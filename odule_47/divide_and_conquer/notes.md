Linear Search
- Loop through
- Most basic search
- Best possible search on array of unsorted data

Binary Search
- If our array is sorted, we can look for values much more quickly.
  - Look at the middle value
    - If correct value, success!
    - If middle is too big, eliminate every value to the right
    - If too small, eliminate every value to the left.
