// var and let have different scoping.  Var is function scoped, let is block scoped.  
// var can also be redeclared, while let cannot.

// const has the same scoping rules as let, see above.  const creates a constant reference
// that cannot be changed, and it cannot be redefined.  var does none of these.

// let and const have the same scoping rules, but the value of a variable created with let
// can be changed, but const cannot be changed.
